This is an assignment i did for my Algorithms and Data Structures Module. 
In this assigment i was required to implement Prim's and Kruskal's algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree for a weighted connected graph and Dijkstraâ€™s shortest path tree (SPT) algorithm. 
This assignment required immense knowlede on algorithms, data structures, spanning trees, and general comprehension.
The Djikstra's (SPT) algorithm solution is found in the Prims folder.
